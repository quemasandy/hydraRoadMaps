# CODE GENERATION RULES

When generating code for this project, you MUST follow these specific guidelines to ensure a didactic and high-quality learning experience:

1.  **VERBOSE & DIDACTIC COMMENTS**:
    *   Do NOT just write code. Explain it.
    *   Add comments to ALMOST EVERY BLOCK of code explaining the "WHY", not just the "WHAT".
    *   Use a "Teacher" tone. Assume the user is a smart junior/mid-level developer who wants to master architecture.

2.  **ARCHITECTURAL FOCUS**:
    *   Explicitly mention which LAYER the code belongs to (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation).
    *   Explain Design Patterns used (e.g., "This is the Strategy Pattern", "This uses Dependency Injection").
    *   Highlight "Big Tech" practices (Scalability, Maintainability, Testing).
    *   When implementing a class, explain its Responsibility (SRP).

3.  **FILE STRUCTURE & NAMING**:
    *   Use descriptive names.
    *   At the top of every file, add a header comment block explaining the purpose of the file within the clean architecture.

4.  **EXAMPLE**:

    ```typescript
    /**
     * DOMAIN SERVICE: OrderCalculator
     * 
     * Responsabilidad: Encapsular la lógica compleja de cálculo de impuestos.
     * Capa: Dominio (No depende de BD ni HTTP).
     */
    export class OrderCalculator {
      // ...
      
      public calculate(total: number): number {
        // Regla de Negocio: Si es mayor a 100, aplicamos descuento.
        if (total > 100) {
             // ...
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **LANGUAGE**:
    *   Unless requested otherwise, keep explanations in Spanish (as per current conversation context).
